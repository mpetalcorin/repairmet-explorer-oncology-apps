# Model Card: RepairMet Explorer

## Model name

RepairMet Explorer

## Model type

Mechanistically curated, rule-based, interpretable decision-support engine for oncology research.

## Version

Current concept release

## Summary

RepairMet Explorer is a transparent scoring framework that integrates DNA repair, replication stress, and metabolic-state features into ranked mechanistic vulnerability hypotheses. It is designed for research hypothesis prioritization rather than clinical prediction.

The system accepts a compact tumour-state feature vector, derives composite biological states, compares the sample to a curated vulnerability library, applies bounded evidence weighting, and returns ranked outputs with contributor traces and suggested next-step assays.

## Intended purpose

The model is intended to help researchers answer the question:

“Given this tumour-like biological profile, which survival dependency appears most plausible, and what should be tested next?”

## Intended users

- molecular biologists
- cancer biologists
- translational researchers
- computational biologists
- biomedical data scientists
- interdisciplinary oncology teams

## Out-of-scope use

The model is not intended for:

- clinical diagnosis
- direct treatment recommendation
- risk prediction for patients
- autonomous medical decision making
- replacement of pathology review, laboratory validation, or clinical judgment

## Inputs

The current release expects ten features scored on a 0 to 100 scale:

- hrd
- fork
- repStress
- atr
- glycolysis
- oxphos
- glutamine
- ros
- redox
- lactate

Optional evidence-weighting inputs:

- pathway
- assay
- omics
- expert

## Internal representation

### Step 1
Normalize each feature to the interval from 0 to 1.

### Step 2
Compress the normalized feature vector into five composite biological states:

- repairDefect
- replicationBurden
- glycolyticAcidLoad
- mitoPlasticity
- redoxFragility

### Step 3
Compare the sample profile against curated hypothesis signatures.

### Step 4
Compute a base mechanistic score and apply a bounded evidence multiplier.

### Step 5
Rank the resulting mechanistic hypotheses.

## Outputs

For each sample, the model returns:

- normalized_features
- composite_state
- ranked_hypotheses

Each ranked hypothesis includes:

- id
- title
- mechanism
- next_step
- score
- base_score
- evidence_multiplier
- explain

## Hypothesis library

The current model includes:

1. POLQ / PARP synthetic lethality axis
2. ATR / WEE1 / CHK1 checkpoint dependence
3. LDHA / lactate export vulnerability
4. GLS / glutamine anaplerosis dependence
5. SLC7A11 / GPX4 redox defense
6. OXPHOS overload and mitochondrial stress

## Scientific assumptions

The model assumes that tumours are:

- adaptive
- stress-laden
- dependency-driven
- mechanistically organized
- representable as interpretable functional states

It also assumes that vulnerabilities emerge from interactions among:

- DNA repair capacity
- replication-stress handling
- metabolic adaptation
- oxidative and redox balance

## Strengths

- transparent scoring logic
- human-readable input space
- contributor-level explanation
- evidence-weighting support
- cohort-compatible workflow
- easy export for reports and team review
- useful for translational hypothesis generation

## Limitations

- rule-based rather than outcome-trained
- not calibrated against clinical endpoints
- no uncertainty quantification in current version
- depends on upstream interpretation of feature values
- limited current hypothesis library
- not tumour-type specific
- cannot autonomously discover new interactions

## Risks and caveats

The model may produce misleading rankings if:

- input scores are poorly estimated
- features are inconsistent across cohorts
- assays are noisy or weakly mapped to the feature layer
- the biological context falls outside the current hypothesis library
- evidence weights are assigned unrealistically

## Evaluation status

The current version is a concept-stage mechanistic prioritization engine. It has been designed for biological coherence and interpretability rather than predictive benchmarking against patient outcomes.

Illustrative use cases show biologically plausible prioritization of:

- checkpoint dependence in replication-stressed samples
- backup repair in HR-deficient samples
- glycolytic acid handling in lactate-dominant samples

Formal large-scale validation remains future work.

## Ethical and safety considerations

Because the model can generate persuasive mechanistic rankings, users should avoid overinterpreting outputs as clinical truth. Results should be treated as structured hypotheses requiring experimental validation.

## Recommended use practice

Use the model as:

- a scientific triage tool
- a discussion aid
- a hypothesis-ranking layer
- a bridge between data review and experimental planning

Do not use the model as:

- a stand-alone clinical decision engine
- a substitute for biological expertise
- a substitute for wet-lab confirmation

## Future improvements

- tumour-type-specific scoring priors
- learned parameter refinement
- formal uncertainty estimation
- assay-to-feature standardization
- larger curated vulnerability library
- external benchmarking on public and internal translational datasets
- calibration against experimental or clinical outcomes

## Maintenance
Any future expansion to real data would require substantial revision of the model Apps description, validation framework, performance metrics, and risk statement.
